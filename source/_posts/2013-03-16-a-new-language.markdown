After having a few moments over the last few months of 'I need to learn something new' - I have decided to teach myself a new language/technology.

According to the internet I need to be learning... well, I just end up confused. Scala, clojure, ruby(well Ruby On Rails for something useful), javascript, functional, JVM based - it just gets silly. To make life simpler, I bit the bullet and just picked one that sounded interesting and I am going to stick with it and try a few projects. Then pick another and try and recreate the projects or just move onto new ones. 

Node.js took my fancy - purely because I have used javascript in the past, I am interested in web applications and it just sounds like a different way of thinking than I am used to. I started a couple of helloworld tutorals and I have decided to stick to it(even though you see posts about [how terrible node.js is(http://dev.hasenj.org/post/31042963934/nodejs-hate)]).

Will it be the language of the future - maybe, javascript is pretty useful across both web and now thanks to node.js, the server. I really want to get into Google's language [Go](www.golang.org) - but that will be later!
