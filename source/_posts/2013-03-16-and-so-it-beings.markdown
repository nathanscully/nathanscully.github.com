I have been thinking about writing for a while. By 'writing' I mean dumping my thoughts and what I have been doing whilst consuming time. 

This is a bit of a motivational project, self improvement even. I am dyslexic, so the thought of writing large chunks of text general makes me uncomfortable. But the more I write the better I get and the more succinct I am in conveying my thoughts. 

I also am a scatter brain. I can focus and work for hours on end and forget what I started out trying to accomplish. The worst is when I work on something and find a useful tidbit of information that I want to reuse 3 months later but can't for the life of me remember. This blog will server as a purpose to document and mamange my tidbits, and for me to have something to show myself what I have been working on. I think everyone needs to remind themsevles what they have accomplished - it is easy to only see what you havent finished, or even started. 

Who am I? A 24 year old from Sydney, Australia. I studied Design Computing with the hopes of becoming an intermediary between Creative and Technical people. A sort of translator between someone who speaks colours and someone who speaks code. For the last 3 years I have been working for a small IT Consultancy company that develops and integrates software and systems around telecommunications and Contact Centres / Call Centres. My role is as a Application Designer/ Voice Consultant/Software Developer/SysAdmin/PreSales/Project Manager - basically just what needs to be done on the day. 90% of my work is developing IVRs(Interactive Voice Response) - Those hated telephone systems that ask you to press 1, press 2 or say what you want. The beauty of the IVRs I develop is that I have full end to end control of the scope, design, development, deployment and maintaince. You learn alot, and very very quickly. 

I code in Java, I know - how uncool... Java does what I want it to do, all my clients are large enterprises (Banks generally) so Java plays very nice with their systems. But it is bloated, and the more I play with other languages(Scala/Javascript/Node.js/Rails/Ruby), I am realising there is so much more out there. I have experience in web lanaguages but I am starting to branch out and learn new things. All these languages/technologies are all getting me excited about creating things for myself, not just for a client. 

I have set this blog up using [Octopress](www.octopress.org). This is a blog framework for [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). So far I love the concept - get rid of the web front end and silly post creation interfaces and just type the post in a text editor of choice. All this is pushed up to github which saves me worring about keeping me a copy and finding hosting. 

I am hoping this easy format will encourage me to keep writing. I am going to start simple and document some tutorials and projects i will be working on. My goal is to really force myself to partake in 'weekend' projects - little apps that I can knock up in a few days. 

And so it begins...
